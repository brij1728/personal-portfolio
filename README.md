# Personal Portfolio

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview

This personal portfolio showcases my work, skills, and projects. The project was built using modern web development tools and frameworks, including:

- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling.
- **MUI** (Material-UI) for UI components.
- **Next-themes** for dark/light mode theme toggling.
- **React Slick** for creating carousels and sliders.
